# 3D Simulation of ISS Orbit Around Earth

This project visualizes the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS) around Earth in a 3D space. The simulation uses the `Skyfield` library to calculate the ISS's position based on TLE (Two-Line Element) data and `matplotlib` to render and animate the orbit. The animation can be saved as a GIF for sharing or further analysis.

## Features
- Calculates ISS's position using real-time TLE data from CelesTrak.
- Visualizes the orbit of the ISS in a 3D space with a rendered Earth sphere.
- Saves the animation as a GIF file for easy sharing.
